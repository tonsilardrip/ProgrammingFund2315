<p>Sites featured in articles like  <a href="http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/worst-websites-of-2010.html">Worst Websites of 2010 </a> often are redesign, which explains why some sites mentioned in my articles don't match their current look. <em>The Daily Sucke</em>r features current examples of bad web design which haven't been fixed (yet).</p>

<p>If you see a site that you think sucks, email the URL to me. <strong>Nopersonal pages </strong>(personal pages are supposed to reflect the individual's   personality and artistic freedom)<strong> or web site designers </strong>(it   would look like a conflict of interest), <strong>or others of their ilk.</strong></p>

<p>If I think there's some merit to your selection, I may post it along with some commentary. <a href="mailto:vincent@webpagesthatsuck.com">If you know of a site that qualifies, let me know.</a></p>
