<h1 class="redHead">The Ten Worst Websites of 2011-First Quarter Contenders</h1>

<p>The first three months of this year have been interesting because I've tried not to feature as many <a href="http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/over-the-top-web-sites.html">Over-The-Top Websites</a> as before.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that there seem to be fewer of these artistically challenged site but, once again, there were an abundance of bad navigation metaphors, with Mystery Meat Navigation leading the way.</p>

<p>Interestingly, only one large corporation made the list. Large corporations usually have the resources to have acceptable-looking websites, although they may make serious mistakes on subpages. Trader Joe's comes to mind..</p>

<p>Gosh. If I remember correctly, the governmentespecially the militarydoesn&rsquo;t support Flash. Of course, our swirling cloud of links is a swirling Flash cloud of links. <a href="http://webpagesthatsuck.smugmug.com/Other/Bad-Web-Design/6837311_tyvTi#1226981199_qVuVa-A-LB" target="_blank">This screenshot of the original home page, taken on a wide-screen monitor, demonstrates why a liquid layout may not be best type of layout to use</a>.</p>

<p>I will refrain from making any jokes about the word &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; in the organization&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p><strong>Other comments #1:</strong> I don't know. Shouldn't a Geospatial agency study geospatial problems? They certainly show a geospatial conundrum on this web site. I mean isn't that the purpose? </p>

<p><strong>Other comments #2:</strong> I clicked on something in the foreground but actually clicked one in the background. Got a result but have no idea for what because there was no confirmation of action. If you want to get lost and stay that way, this is the site for you! </p>

<p><strong>Other comments #3:</strong>   I think this fails the &quot;Man from Mars&quot; test the site is full of acronyms and there's no statement of what it's about. The motto &quot;Know the Earth....Show the Way&quot; does not help the least little bit. <br />
<br />
Also, the left edge of the cloud of links gets cut off. So you get &quot;EPWATER HORIZON&quot; instead of &quot;DEEPWATER HORIZON&quot; and so forth.
