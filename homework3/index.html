    <h1>Animals to Show</h1>
    <p>
        Here you will find a link to what we have on display by clicking on the Display button on the top of the page, or at the end of this paragraph. Making donations always helps us to keep the animals environment, living conditions clean and regularly maintained. This also helps us with medical and dental cost as well as proving meals. The donations help us not only care for the animals we have but take in new animals that need a safe home. You may donate to the animal of your choice. We have several animals to show you. The following animals are animals that we currently have in our facility:
<p> 
<ul>
    <li>Gorillas</li>
    <li>Chimpanzee</li>
    <li>Northern Bald Eagle</li>
    <li>Tigers</li>
</ul> 
</p>
