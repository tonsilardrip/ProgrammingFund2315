     I love to kayak. <img src="images\kayak.gif" alt="Kayak is a boat" title="Kayaking rules!" width="90" height="68" /> The rougher the water the more fun!

     One of my goals is to climb a mountain.

     It takes training and persistence. 
	 But the view from the top is amazing. Along the way you may even see some waterfalls. <img src="images\waterfall.jpg" alt="Looks like the amazon waterfalls" title="Beautiful" width="180" height="130" />
